# Project: examples/my-example-project

This is a JanitorAI script project generated by `janitor-script-scaffolder`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Development

- **Logic**: Edit `script_def.js` to define your state, stats, and game logic.
- **Resources**: Edit text files in `resources/` for system prompts and long descriptions.
- **Source**: Advanced users can edit `src/entry.js` to modify how the engine processes the script.

### 3. Build

Compile your script for JanitorAI:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates:
- `dist/effective_script.js`: The full script (ES5 compatible).
- `dist/effective_script.min.js`: Minified version.

### 4. Testing

Test your script logic locally without deploying:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs a simulated conversation turn against your script logic.

## Deployment

1. Copy the content of `dist/effective_script.js`.
2. Paste it into the **Scripts/Advanced** section of your JanitorAI character.
